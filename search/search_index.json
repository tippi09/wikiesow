Therefor we mainly run Raspbian headless and enable graphical output only if necessary (e.g. for media uses with Kodi). Download latest Raspbian Desktop image First of all download the latest Raspbian Desktop image from raspberrypi.org (Note: Do not use the Raspbian Lite image if you want to get graphical output as well) . Extract the zip file and remove it afterwards. Make sure to adjust the date if necessary: # unzip 2018 -11-13-raspbian-stretch.zip # rm 2018 -11-13-raspbian-stretch.zip Write Raspbian image to the SD Card To write the image we have to find our SD card first. On macOS we run diskutil list with the SD card still unplugged . Then you can insert the card and run diskutil list once more. You should see another device listed as a new entry just like this one: /dev/disk2 (internal, physical): #: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER 0: FDisk_partition_scheme *32.0 GB disk2 1: DOS_FAT_32 LABEL 32.0 GB disk2s1 Danger Make sure to replace the disk number (disk2 to disk#) corresponding to your diskutil list output before calling the following statements. With the identifier of the SD card we can now unmount it before writing the image: # diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2 Now use dd to write the image: # sudo dd bs = 1m if = 2018 -11-13-raspbian-stretch.img of = /dev/rdisk2 conv = sync Note If this command fails you can try using disk2 instead of rdisk2 : # sudo dd bs = 1m if = 2018 -11-13-raspbian-stretch.img of = /dev/disk2 conv = sync After the dd command has finished writing the data you can eject the card: # sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdisk2 Now insert the SD card into your Raspberry and boot Raspbian for the first time. Default user and root password settings After completing the initial configuration process you should enable SSH (if not already done) and login to your Raspberry via SSH. The default credentials are: User: pi Password: raspberry # ssh pi@raspberrypi First change the default root password by calling passwd root and create a new user for SSH access: # adduser \u00abuser\u00bb # usermod -a -G sudo \u00abuser\u00bb After testing sudo access with the created user the default user pi can be deleted: # deluser -remove-home pi General Raspbian settings A nice tool to easily adjust settings for Raspbian is the raspi-config . After using SSH to login to your Raspberry it can be started by calling: # sudo raspi-config After running the aforementioned statement, navigate to Network Options - Hostname . Here you can change the default hostname raspberrypi to a new name you prefer. Afterwards go to Boot Options - Desktop / CLI in raspi-config . Choose the console option to avoid booting the more expensive desktop mode after a restart. Configure boot configuration Now we can configure some services and device trees to be loaded on boot. All the options in this section are set in the /boot/config.txt file: # sudo vim /boot/config.txt Disable HDMI output Do disable complete HDMI output on boot and avoid that the Raspberry turns on a connected TV with a HDMI-CEC event, add the following lines in your config.txt : # uncomment to enable hdmi output on boot hdmi_blanking=2 hdmi_ignore_cec_init=1 Disable WiFi and Bluetooth Danger Do not disable WiFi if you need it for SSH. Otherwise you could lock yourself out of your own system. As I do not need the Bluetooth of my Raspberry and with it being connected to the internet via LAN, I turn off the WiFi and Bluetooth modules to save some energy by adding the following lines to my config.txt : # uncomment to enable wifi and bluetooth dtoverlay=pi3-disable-wifi dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt Load device tree for the HiFiBerry As my HiFi system is connected to my Raspberry, I am using a HiFiBerry board for an improved sound experience. To load the correct device tree and disable the onboard, I added the following lines to my config.txt : # Disabled onboard audio, loaded HiFiberry device tree # dtparam=audio=on dtoverlay=hifiberry-dac Note The device tree that you have to load for your HiFiBerry depends on the concrete board you use. I am using a DAC+ DSP. For information of device trees for different models, take a look here . To check out which sound card is loaded, reboot and afterwards call: # aplay -l You should see an output that looks something like this: **** Liste der Hardware-Ger\u00e4te (PLAYBACK) **** Karte 0: sndrpihifiberry [snd_rpi_hifiberry_dac], Ger\u00e4t 0: HifiBerry DAC HiFi pcm5102a-hifi-0 [] Sub-Ger\u00e4te: 1/1 Sub-Ger\u00e4t #0: subdevice #0","title":"Multi-purpose Raspbian setup"},{"location":"Raspberry_Pi/semihead/#multi-purpose-raspbian-setup","text":"In this guide we will setup Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi so that it can be used for many purposes while keeping energy consumption as low as possible.

This is especially useful if your ISP only grants a Dual-Stack Lite connection. Raspberry Pi settings At first we have to enable the Pis IPv6-module by editing the /etc/modules file: # sudo vim /etc/modules Add the following line at the end of the file: ipv6 After a reboot you can check if your Raspberry now has an IPv6 address by calling the statement ip a . To make sure that your SSH client also accepts connections via IPv6 and not only via IPv4, we have to adjust the corresponding config file: # sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config Look for a line that begins with AddressFamily and make sure it is not set to inet (IPv4 use only). You can decide if you would like to enable IPv4 and IPv6 connections (by using any ), or if you go for IPv6 connections only ( inet6 ). I decided to enable both communication protocols, so that my line looks like this: AddressFamily any If you like, you can also disable password authentification for SSH access, this would improve security by forcing clients to use SSH-keys instead. For further instructions on how to setup SSH-keys take a look here . To disable password authentification just set the following line in your sshd_config : PasswordAuthentication no Router settings To make sure your internet router also works with IPv6 DS Lite and that it assigns global IPv6 addresses to your local devices (including your Raspberry Pi), some adjustments might have to be made (Note: These settings depend on the router you use. I'm using an AVM Fritzbox, whose configuration can differ from your router) . At first I make sure my router uses a native IPv6-connection instead of IPv4 tunneling for IPv6 connectivity by setting the following in Zugangsdaten - IPv6 : Afterwards we configure our DHCPv6 server in Netzwerk - Netzwerkeinstellungen - IPv6 Adressen , so that it assigns IPv6 addresses from your address range to the devices you are port forwarding, making them directly addressable from the internet: TODO: Describe port forwarding At this point you should be able to connect to your Raspberry Pi from the internet via SSH using the following command: # ssh -6 user @ global ipv6 Configure Dynamic DNS (optional) By configuring DynDNS you can connect to your Raspberry by using a hostname instead of the complete IPv6 address. I'm using a hostname from dynv6.com as they support IPv6, but of course you are free to choose a different service. After creating a hostname we have to make sure the hostname is always pointing at the current IPv6 address of the Pi. Therefor I wrote a small script based on a script from dynv6.com : #!/bin/sh -e hostname = yourhostname device = $2 token = yourtoken file = $HOME /.dynv6.addr6 [ -e $file ] old = ` cat $file ` if [ -z $netmask ] ; then netmask = 128 fi if [ -n $device ] ; then device = dev $device fi address = $( ip -6 addr list scope global $device | grep -v fd | sed -n s/.*inet6 \\([0-9a-f:]\\+\\).*/\\1/p | head -n 1 ) if [ -e /usr/bin/curl ] ; then bin = curl -fsS elif [ -e /usr/bin/wget ] ; then bin = wget -O- else echo neither curl nor wget found exit 1 fi if [ -z $address ] ; then echo no IPv6 address found exit 1 fi # address with netmask current = $address / $netmask if [ $old = $current ] ; then echo IPv6 address unchanged exit fi # send addresses to dynv6 $bin http://dynv6.com/api/update?hostname= $hostname ipv6= $current token= $token $bin http://ipv4.dynv6.com/api/update?hostname= $hostname ipv4=auto token= $token # save current address echo $current $file This script sends the latest IPv4 and IPv6 address to dynv6 if the adresses have changed, so that your hostname always points to the right direction. I have saved the script in my Raspberry Pis home directory in a file called dynv6.sh. Before we proceed, make sure you can execute the script: # chmod +x dynv6.sh Now we can configure a cronjob that executes the script every 5 minutes, keeping the hostname updated: # crontab -e Now add a line that looks like this: */5 * * * * /path/to/dynv6.sh Now you should be able to connect to your Raspberry by using ssh -6 user @ your hostname instead of your IPv6 address only.
